Software Libre lover, happy vim user, automatization addict, casual gamer.

Eager to learn everything I can about technology; Software design, CD, CI, TDD, Microservices architecture, docker, frontend automatization, devops techniques and every programming language which allows me to play with all those things.

I really enjoy Sci-FI and cyberpunk stuff.

### What things I have done
