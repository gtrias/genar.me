In computer science I am a fond of this beautiful field and my personal goal are learn so much are possible.

I’m interested in the computer science and imagine myself in the future as programmer and software designer since I had six years old

I’m specially interested in Open Source. In that sense my first experience with Open Source world was when I had twelve years old, and since then I never stop to experiment with the different GNU/Linux distributions as well the tonnes of quality Software.

I consider myself a awaken person, dynamic too and with eager to learn every day too much
